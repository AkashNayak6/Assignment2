# Assignment 2: Analysis of Algorithms, Sorting

The assignment consists of mergesort, quicksort, linked list, time complexity, constant space, and problem solving skills. Also, pdf's are used to show snippets of code to explain the structure/implementation, and what causes bottleneck and where. Also run time and time complexity are written to show the recurrence relation, how quick are the sorts/insertions.
